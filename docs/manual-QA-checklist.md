# Manual QA Checklist - P0 Critical Features

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step manual testing checklist for non-technical users to verify P0 critical features work correctly

---

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Login as the specified role** using test credentials (see TEST_USERS.md)
2. **Follow each step** in order, clicking through the UI
3. **Check the expected result** for each step
4. **Mark as ✅ Pass** or ❌ **Fail** with notes if something doesn't work

**Behavior note:** Client application submission with validation warnings is by design. The user sees a confirmation dialog and can choose to submit anyway; the success message will say "Application submitted successfully with warnings."

---

## Test User Credentials

- **Client**: `client@test.com` / `Test@123456`
- **KAM**: `kam@test.com` / `Test@123456`
- **Credit Team**: `credit@test.com` / `Test@123456`
- **NBFC**: `nbfc@test.com` / `Test@123456`

---

## Credit status and state machine (manual test)

Use this to verify status transitions and that the UI only shows allowed next statuses. See also `docs/AUDIT-BROKEN-LOGIC-AND-SYSTEMS.md` and `backend/src/services/statusTracking/statusStateMachine.ts`.

- **Credit: Pending Credit Review** → Allowed next: Sent to NBFC, In Negotiation, Rejected, Credit Query (raise query to KAM).
- **NBFC decision** → Approved or Rejected (from Sent to NBFC).
- **Admin close** → Credit/Admin can close from appropriate terminal/near-terminal statuses.
- **Retries:** Frontend credit status update retries once on 404/timeout (cold-start); retry sends the same payload (idempotent, no double-apply).
